## 📈 Project Overview

The project investigates **net employment change** across multiple UK industry sectors (classified by 2-digit SIC codes). The goal is to quickly identify which sectors experienced the most significant increases or decreases in job counts during the given period.

The data visualisation was done using **Tableau**, with a **horizontal bar chart** for clear comparative insight.

### 📌 Key Insights

- 📈 **Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities** showed the highest increase (+134,655 jobs)
- 📉 **Public Administration** and **Manufacturing** experienced the largest losses (-49,538 and -28,040 respectively)
- Other notable growing sectors include:
  - Administrative (+120,169)
  - Human Health (+57,578)
